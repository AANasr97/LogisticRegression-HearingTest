# Logistic Regression Project

Welcome to the Logistic Regression Project! In this project, we explore the effects of age and physical health on hearing loss, specifically the ability to hear high-pitched tones. The goal is to build a classification model that predicts someone's likelihood to hear high-frequency sounds based solely on their features, such as age and physical score. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and key components.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Data Description:
   - Conducted an experiment on 5000 participants to study the effects of age and physical health on hearing loss.
   - Collected data on participants' age, physical score, and the result of an audio test (pass or no pass).
   
2. Data Exploration:
   - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and statistics.
   - Visualized the distribution of test results, age, and physical scores.
   - Investigated correlations between features.

3. Model Building:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Scaled the features to prepare them for modeling.
   - Created a logistic regression model to predict test results based on age and physical score.

4. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and the confusion matrix.
   - Interpreted model coefficients and their impact on test result predictions.

5. Performance Curves:
   - Visualized ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and AUC (Area Under the Curve) to assess classification performance.
   - Displayed precision-recall curves to further evaluate model performance.
